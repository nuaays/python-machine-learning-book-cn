###Chapter 1. Giving Computers the Ability to Learn from Data
第一章，给于计算机学习数据的能力

In my opinion, machine learning, the application and science of algorithms that makes sense of data, is the most exciting field of all the computer sciences! We are living in an age where data comes in abundance; using the self-learning algorithms from the field of machine learning, we can turn this data into knowledge. Thanks to the many powerful open source libraries that have been developed in recent years, there has probably never been a better time to break into the machine learning field and learn how to utilize powerful algorithms to spot patterns in data and make predictions about future events.
在我看来，机器学习(应用和算法科学是数据有意思)是所有计算机科学中最令人激动的领域。
我们生活在数据大量冗余的年代，使用机器学习中的自学习算法我们可以将数据转换为知识。
感谢众多近几年被开发的强大的开源库，使进入机器学习领域和学习如何使用强大算法来为数据分离以及预测未来事件，成为可能。
In this chapter, we will learn about the main concepts and different types of machine learning. Together with a basic introduction to the relevant terminology, we will lay the groundwork for successfully using machine learning techniques for practical problem solving.
在本章中，我们将学习机器学习的主要概念和分类。同时简单介绍下相关术语，我们将依靠基本原理来成功使用机器学习技术解决实际问题。
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
本章有以下几个主题
```
####The general concepts of machine learning 机器学习的一般概念
